      Chocolate or cocoa is a food made from roasted and ground cacao seed
      kernels that is available as a liquid, solid, or paste, either on its own
      or as a flavoring agent in other foods. Cacao has been consumed in some
      form since at least the Olmec civilization (19thâ€“11th century BCE),[1][2]
      and later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages
      before being introduced to Europe in the 16th century.
